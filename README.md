# Mission-to-Mars

Our goal was to BeautifulSoup and WebDriver in python along with HTML and MongoDB to create a flask application which scrapes various information regarding the planet Mars. Among these things are different images of the hemispheres of the planet. Unfortunately I was pressed on time and wasn't able to customize the layout of the webpage further. Below is a screenshot of the unfinished layout. I'm hoping to return to this and add more soon.
